# Air Quality Analysis in Tamil Nadu

## Project Overview
This repository contains the code and resources for analyzing air quality data from monitoring stations in Tamil Nadu. The objective of this project is to gain insights into air pollution trends, identify pollution hotspots, and develop predictive models for RSPM/PM10 levels based on SO2 and NO2 levels. The analysis approach involves data cleaning, preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, visualization, and predictive modeling.

## Data Source
The air quality data used in this project is sourced from -- link .
